	<H1>Options Extensions screen</H1>
	<p>This screen allows you to enable/disable extensions that are
		available to ZAP.</p>
	<H3>Enable/Disable Extensions</H3>
	Enabled extensions will be loaded by ZAP, thus adding the
	functionalities provided by those extensions. Disabled extensions will
	not be loaded.

	<H3>Core Extensions</H3>
	Core extensions are extensions that if disabled will impair ZAP's
	minimal functionality. Extensions marked as core cannot be disabled.
	<p>
		<i>Note: Core extensions can be disabled through the configuration
			file, although it's not recommend.</i>
	</p>

	<H3>Extensions' Dependencies</H3>
	Extensions may depend on other extensions to work. When one of those
	extensions (dependencies) is disabled it will make ZAP automatically
	disable all the extensions that depend on them. So it may happen that
	when disabling one extension other extensions (that depend on it) will
	also be disabled. Automatically disabled extensions will not be allowed
	to be enabled until all the dependencies are enabled.

	<H3>Location of extensions available to ZAP</H3>
	To make an extension available to ZAP it must be in one the following
	locations:
	<ul>
		<li>"plugin" directory located in the ZAP's folder;</li>
		<li>"plugin" directory located in the ZAP user's folder.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<i>Note: You will need to restart ZAP for the changes to take
			effect.</i>
	</p>
