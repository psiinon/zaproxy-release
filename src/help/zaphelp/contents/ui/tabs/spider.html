	<h1>Spider tab</h1>
	<p>
		The Spider tab shows you the set of unique URIs found by the <a
			href="../../start/concepts/spider.html">Spider</a> during the scans.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current Site the information is referring to can be selected via
		the toolbar or the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>. The Spider can
		be run on multiple Sites in parallel and the results for each scan are
		shown by selecting the proper Site.
	</p>

	<p>The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start,
		stop, pause and resume the scan. A progress bar shows how far the scan
		of the selected site has progressed.</p>

	<br /> For each request you can see:
	<ul>
		<li>Processed - Whether the URI was processed by the Spider or
			was skipped from fetching because of a rule (e.g. it was out of
			scope)</li>
		<li>Method - The HTTP method, e.g. GET or POST, through which the
			resource should be accessed</li>
		<li>URI - the resource found</li>
		<li>Flags - any information about the URI (e.g. if it's a seed or
			why was it not processed)</li>
	</ul>
