<H1>Alerts tab</H1>

<p>
The Alerts tab show the <a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">Alerts</a> 
that have been raised in this session.<br/>
The alerts are displayed in a tree in risk order in the left hand pane, and each
node of the tree shows the total number of alerts underneath it.<br/>
Selecting an alert with one click will display it in the right hand pane.<br/>
Double clicking an alert will display the <a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert</a> 
dialog which will allow you to change the alert details.
</p>
<p>
Alerts can either be raised by <a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">Automated scanning</a>
or manually via the <a href="history.html">History tab</a>.
</p>

	<H2>Filtering alerts</H2>
	The filter buttons, shown immediately above the tree, allows you to restrict which alerts are displayed:
	<H3>
		<img src="../../images/fugue/target.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;/&nbsp;
		<img src="../../images/fugue/target-grey.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;
		Show only URLs in Scope / Show all URLs
	</H3>
		Allows to show only the alerts of URLs that are in <a href="../../start/concepts/scope.html">scope</a>.
	<H3>
		<img src="../../images/16/094.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;/&nbsp;
		<img src="../../images/16/earth-grey.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;
		Link / Unlink with Sites selection
	</H3>
		Allows to show only the alerts of the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a> selected tree node.
	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong> Selecting one filter will disable the other as they are mutually
		exclusive.
	</p>

<H2>Right click menu</H2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<H3>Resend...</H3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request associated with the alert after making any changes to it that you want to.
