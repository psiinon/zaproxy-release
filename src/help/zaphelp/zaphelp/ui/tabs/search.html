<p>The Search tab allows you to search for regular expressions in all of the
URLs, requests and responses.</p>
<p>Enter the regular expression you would like to search for in the search
box and either press return or click on the search button:

<p>A pull down allows you to choose whether to search across the URLs,
the requests, the responses or everything.</p>
<p>All URLs, requests or responses which contain the search pattern will
be displayed in the tab.<br/>
You may find it useful to add .* to your search term -
this will give you more context e.g. password.*</p>
<p>You can use the 
<img src="../../images/16/107.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /> Next and
<img src="../../images/16/108.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /> Previous
buttons to view found search terms in the <a href="request.html">Request</a>
and <a href="response.html">Response tabs</a>. <br/>
Note that the search term may appear more than once in any request and response - 
only the first instance
will be shown in the list but the Next and Previous buttons will show all of
the instances.</p>
<p>You can also go directly to a specific instance by clicking on the relevant
line in the results list.</p>
