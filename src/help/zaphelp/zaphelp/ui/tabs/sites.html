<H1>Sites tab</H1>
<p>
The Sites tab shows all of the URLs visited in a tree structure. <br/>
You can select any of the nodes in the tree to display the request and response for that URL 
in the relevant tabs.<br/>
</p>

<H2>Right click menu</H2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<H3>Delete (from view)</H3>
This will remove the node and all of its children from the Sites tab.

<H3>Purge (from DB)</H3>
This will completely remove the node and all of its children from the database.

<H3>Resend...</H3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<H3>Spider...</H3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/spider.html">Spider dialog</a> which allows you to  
<a href="../../start/concepts/spider.html">spider</a> the node and all of its children. 
This will search all of the nodes for new links that you have not visited yet.

<H3>Break...</H3>
This will bring up a new window which will allow you to set a 
<a href="../../start/concepts/breakpoints.html">break point</a> on that URL.<br/>
The break point is defined via a regular expression. If you visit a URL which matches this 
expression then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request and/or the
response.
