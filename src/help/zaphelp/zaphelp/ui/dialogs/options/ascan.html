<H1>Options Active Scan screen</H1>
<p>
This screen allows you to configure the <a href="../../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a> options:

<H3>Number of hosts scanned concurrently</H3>
The maximum number of hosts that will be scanned at the same time.
Increasing this may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on.

<H3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</H3>
The number of threads the scanner will use per host.<br>
Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.

<H3>Delay when scanning in milliseconds</H3>
The delay in milliseconds between each request.<br>
Setting this to a non zero value will increase the time an active scan takes, but will put less of a strain
on the target host.
