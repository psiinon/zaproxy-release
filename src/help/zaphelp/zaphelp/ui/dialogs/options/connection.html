<H1>Options Connection screen</H1>
<p>
The Options Connection screen allows you to configure the ZAP connection options:

<H3>Timeout in seconds</H3>
This makes is easier to test slow applications.

<H3>SSLTunneling for ports</H3>
Browsers may use the HTTP CONNECT method to establish connections through a proxy.
It occurs for HTTPS connections, but this method is allowed to be used for non-SSL connections too.
<br><br>
This option allows to set ports where HTTPS should be used. Per default only requests to port 443 establish a secure connection.
You may change this if your application uses secure services on non-standard ports. Otherwise the connection is not secured.
<br><br>
Use a comma to separate several ports like here "443,563,81".

<H3>Single Cookie Request Header</H3>
Controls whether the ZAP's managed cookies (<a href="../../tlmenu/edit.html">Enable Session Tracking (Cookie)</a>) should be set
on a single "Cookie" request header or multiple "Cookie" request headers, when sending an HTTP request to the server.

<H3>Use Proxy chain</H3>
This section allows you to connect to another proxy for outgoing connections.<br/>
This is often required in a corporate environment.

<H3>Proxy authentication</H3>
This section allows you to configure the outgoing proxy authentication.
