<H1>Manage Add-ons</H1>
<p>
This allows you to manage the <a href="../../start/concepts/addons.html">add-ons</a>
that you have installed and download new ones from the Add-on Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
Two tabs are available:
<H2>Installed</H2>
This tab shows you the version of ZAP you are running, all of the installed add-ons 
and allows you to check for any updates to ZAP or any of the add-ons.<br/>
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it. <br/>
You can also uninstall add-ons from this tab - typically add-ons are dynamically removed from the ZAP UI
as soon as you uninstall them.

<H2>Marketplace</H2>
This tab shows you all of the add-ons that you dont have installed which are available from the 
Add-on Marketplace.<br/>
You will need to 'Check for updates' before you can see the add-ons available.<br/>
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it. <br/>
You can install any of the add-ons listed - typically add-ons are dynamically added to the ZAP UI
as soon as you install them.
