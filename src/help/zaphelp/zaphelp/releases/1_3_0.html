	</p>

<H3>Daemon mode and API</H3>
ZAP can now be run in the background using the '-daemon' command line option.<br>
An initial API has been implemented in XML, JSON and HTML.<br>
If ZAP is running as a daemon then the API is automatically enabled, otherwise the API must be enabled via the Options API screen.<br>
The API can be navigated by opening http://zap/ in your browser when proxying via ZAP.

Details TBA.

<H3>Copy support</H3>
Most of the panels now provide a 'right click' 'Copy' menu option, including the Port Scan and Brute Force panels. 

<H3>Port scanner proxy support and timeout option</H3>
The Port Scanner can now use the outgoing proxy (if configured) and the timeout in milliseconds can also now be set.

<H3>ZAP headless mode</H3>
Starting ZAP with the "-daemon" command line option will cause it to run in the background in 'headless' mode, 
meaning that no UI is displayed.

<H3>Request and response break buttons</H3>
There are now 2 'Set Break' buttons to allow breaks to be set on all requests and all responses independently.
