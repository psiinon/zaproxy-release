	<h1>Authentication</h1>
	<p>
		ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called <b>Authentication
			Methods</b>) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each <a
			href="contexts.html"><b>Context</b></a> has an Authentication Method
		defined which dictates how authentication is handled.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to detect when response messages from web servers correspond
		to authenticated requests, a set of indicators can be configured. The
		<b>Logged in indicator</b>, when present in a response message (either
		the header or the body), signifies that the response message
		corresponds to an authenticated request (e.g. presence of a 'logout
		link' or a 'Welcome back, User X' pattern). Similarly, the <b>Logged
			out indicator</b> indicates an unauthenticated request (e.g. presence of
		a 'login link'). Only the presence of one of the 2 indicators is
		sufficient for proper functionality. In the case neither of the
		indicators has been specified, all messages are considered, by
		default, authenticated.
	</p>

	<p>Authentication methods can be used in multiple places around
		ZAP. Some of the examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>defining Users and automatic login</li>
		<li>detection of authenticated/unauthenticated states</li>
		<li>performing automatic re-authentication</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Multiple authentication methods have been implemented and the
		system supports easy addition of new methods, according to user needs.
		They main ones are described below.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="manual">Manual Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>This method allows users to perform the authentication manually
		(e.g. authenticate in the browser while proxy-ing through ZAP) and
		then select the corresponding HttpSession. As the actual
		authentication is being performed by you, this method does not support
		re-authentication in case the webapp logs an user out.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="formBased">Form-Based Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		done by submitting a form or performing a GET request to a 'login url'
		using a 'username/password' pair of authentication credentials.
		Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a> or using the contextual PopupMenu: <i>Flag as...
			Form-Based Authentication Login Request</i>.
