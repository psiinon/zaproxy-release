	<h1>Spider</h1>
	<p>The spider is a tool than is used to automatically discover new
		resources (URLs) on a particular Site. It begins with a list of URLs
		to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is
		started. The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies all the
		hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit and
		the process continues recursively as long as new resources are found.
	</p>

	<p>There are 4 methods of starting the Spider, diferentiated by the
		seed list with which it starts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spider Site - The seed list contains all the existing URIs
			already found for the selected site.</li>
		<li>Spider Subtree - The seed list contains all the existing URIs
			already found and present in the subtree of the selected node.</li>
		<li>Spider URL - The seed list contains only the URI
			corresponding to the selected node (in the Site Tree).</li>
		<li>Spider all in Scope - The seed list contains all the URIs the
			user has selected as being 'In Scope'.</li>
	</ul>
	<i>More details can be found below, in the "Accessed via" section </i>


	<p>During the processing of an URL, the Spider makes a request to
		fetch the resource and then parses the response, identifying
		hyperlinks. It currently has the following behavior when processing
		types of responses:</p>

	<h4>HTML</h4>
	Processes the specific tags, identifying links to new resources:
	<ul>
		<li>Base - Proper handling</li>
		<li>A, Link, Area - 'href' attribute</li>
		<li>Frame, IFrame, Script, Img - 'src' attribute</li>
		<li>Meta - 'http-equiv' for 'location' and 'refresh'</li>
		<li>Form - proper handling of Forms with both GET and POST
			method. The fields values are generated validly, including <a
			href="http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_form_input_types.asp">HTML
				5.0 input types</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Comments - Valid tags found in comments are also analyzed, if
			specified in the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/spider.html">Options
				Spider screen</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Robots.txt file</h4>
	If set in the
	<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/spider.html">Options Spider
		screen</a>, it also analyzes the 'Robots.txt' file and tries to identify
	new resources using the specified rules. It has to be mentioned that
	the Spider does not follow the rules specified in the 'Robots.txt'
	file.

	<h4>Non-HTML Text Response</h4>
	Text responses are parsed scanning for the URL pattern

	<h4>Non-Text response</h4>
	Currently, the Spider does not process this type of resources.
