<p>
Contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together.<br/>
You can define any contexts you like, but it is expected that a context will correspond to 
a web application.<br/>
It is recommended that you define a new contexts for each web application
that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as you test each one.

</p>
<p>
Contexts are defined as a set of regular expressions (regexs) which are applied to all of the URLs in the
<a href="../../ui/tabs/sites.html">Sites tab</a>.<br/>
You can configure contexts via:
<ul>
<li>Right click menu items in the in the Sites or History tab</li>
<li>The <a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html">Session Contexts dialogs</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
