ZAP User Guide</H1>
<p>
Welcome to the The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) User Guide.<br/><br/>
This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online at 
http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/HelpIntro
</p>
<p>
ZAP is a penetration test tool designed to be used to make web applications more secure.<br/>
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not have permission to test.
</p>
<p>
While ZAP can detect some security issues automatically, 
it is primarily designed to help you find security vulnerabilities manually.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unlike some security tools it is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience.<br/>
As such it is suitable for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.<br/>
You will still need to have a good understanding of how web applications work. 
</p>
<p>
If you are new to ZAP then its recommended that you look at the <a href="start/start.html">Getting Started</a> section.
</p>
<p>
ZAP is a fork of the open source variant of the <a href="paros.html">Paros Proxy</a>.
