      <H1>Basic Useage Information</H1>
      <p>To start DirBuster the following steps need to be undertaken:</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the target host as a full URL.  eg http://www.target.com/</li>
            <li>Select the if you wish to wish DirBuster to use only GET requests, or to auto switch between HEAD/GET<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the web server does not support head requests, then select GET only</li>
                    <li>In auto mode DirBuster will attempt to establish if the server supports HEAD requests, only if it does will DirBuster use HEAD requests</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Select the number of threads required for testing.  10 threads will normally result in ~300 requests/sec.  However at 200+ threads ~6000 requests/sec can be obtained, use this speed with caution!</li>
            <li>Select if you wish to use list based file and dir guessing or a pure brute force.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If list based testing is selected enter list you wish to use via the Browse button</li>
                    <li>If pure brute force, select the char set you wish to use, and enter both min and max length of the generated string</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>Select the method of testing Standard or URL Fuzz</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>If standard testing selected, choose if you wish to test for directoies and/or files, the start point, and names of any file extentions you wish to use.</li>
                      <li>If fuzz based testing is selected, enter the URL, and subsiute the point of fuzz with {fuzz}</li>
                
                   </ul>
            <li>All should be good, so hit the start button</li>            
        </ol>
